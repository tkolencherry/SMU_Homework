                        <h4>
                            Key Takeaway One:
                            <small class="text-muted">Income Impacts Acces to Healthcare</small>
                        </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In general it looks like there's a positive correlation between the poverty rate in a given state and the percentage of the population that lacks access to healthcare within that state. </li>
                            <li>Additionally, there appears to be a positive correlation between the poverty rate in a given state and the obesity rate within the state. This relationship makes sense when considering that many low SES areas are affiliated
                                with food deserts, meaning that residents must travel further and longer to purchase groceries. The length of their travel time limits the viable food options they should buy to ones that can keep fresh throughout the duration
                                of the trip, meaning that fresh vegetables and meats, if available, are often off the table. Additionally, fresh foods are often sold at higher prices, meaning that households with a lower budget for groceries are faced
                                with a tradeoff between quality of food and quantity of food. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>
                            Key Takeaway Two:
                            <small class="text-muted">Age Impacts Smoking (as of 2014)</small>
                        </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In general as the median age of a given state increases, so does the percentage of the population that smokes. </li>
                            <li>It's highly likely that there are confounding variables at play with these two factors, but in general there seems to be a trend of older populations smoking more. </li>
                            <li>Utah seems like an outlier, but it could simply be a cultural difference considering the large Church of the Latter Day Saints population located in the state. This trend makes sense, though, as the United States has seen several
                                cultural shifts with regards to smoking. While smoking was often encouraged and acceptable up through the 90's, ad campaigns by various organizations and societal shifts had generally made smoking more taboo in 2014. This
                                shift corresponds with older residents smoking more since they grew up with different attitudes towards the habit. It is important to note that this data is six years old, so cultural mores around smoking have likely shifted
                                again with the advent of vaping. </li>
                        </ul>
